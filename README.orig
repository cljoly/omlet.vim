omlet.vim -- filetype OCaml for VIm
Copyright (c) 2005 David Baelde

OMLet includes:
 - A slightly modified syntax file;
 - A much better indentation, which aims at becoming as good as Tuareg;
 - A plugin which performs folding -- I like it a lot, but if you don't want
   it you can simply turn it using the following command in your ~/.vimrc:
    autocmd FileType omlet set foldmethod=manual
