omlet.vim -- filetype OCaml for VIm
Copyright (c) 2005 David Baelde

OMLet includes:
 - A slightly modified syntax file;
 - A much better indentation, which aims at becoming as good as Tuareg;
 - A plugin which performs folding, plus the official features
   you can simply turn folding off: define no_ocaml_folding in your .vimrc
   > let no_ocaml_folding=1
   If you don't want omlet to set key bindings, define no_ocaml_maps or
   no_plugin_maps.

Tricks
------

If you like to check type annotations, try my script at:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1197
I'm currently thinking about the best solution for that, maybe I'll finally
include Zack's python code...

Key mappings are prefixed by <LocalLeader>, which defaults to \.
If you find something like . or , more accessible, customize your .vimrc:
> let maplocalleader="."

If you've been using emacs for a while, you might be a <tab> addict.
Adding the following line to your .vimrc will make <tab> run indentation
when hit in insert mode (C-f is the default for that in vim):
autocmd FileType omlet set indentkeys+=,!^I

Omlet indents with spaces, so if you want a full compatibility with emacs's
tuareg-mode, it is recommended to use space-only indentation with emacs:
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

Please make sure that the following line is in your ~/.vimrc, otherwise
indentation won't be loaded automatically:
filetype plugin indent on
