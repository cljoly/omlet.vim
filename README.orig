omlet.vim -- filetype OCaml for VIm
Copyright (c) 2005 David Baelde

OMLet includes:
 - A slightly modified syntax file;
 - A much better indentation, which aims at becoming as good as Tuareg;
 - A plugin which performs folding -- I like it a lot, but if you don't want
   it you can simply turn it off using the following command in your
   ~/.vimrc:
    autocmd FileType omlet set foldmethod=manual
   Deleting ~/.vim/ftplugin/omlet.vim also works ;)

If you've been using emacs for a while, you might be a <tab> addict.
Adding the following line to your .vimrc will make <tab> run indentation
when hit in insert mode (C-f is the default for that in vim):
autocmd FileType omlet set indentkeys+=,!^I

If you like to check type annotations, try my script at:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1197

Omlet indents with spaces, so if you want a full compatibility with emacs's
tuareg-mode, it is recommended to use space-only indentation with emacs:
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

Please make sure that the following line is in your ~/.vimrc, otherwise
indentation won't be loaded automatically:
filetype plugin indent on
